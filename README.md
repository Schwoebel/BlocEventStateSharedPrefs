# bloc_shared_prefs

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a BlocStateEventBuilder implementation for a Settings screen that uses SharedPreferences

A few resources that I used for this project

- [Boring Flutter Show #16 SharedPreferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-My77Yc27g)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- [Reactive Programming - Streams - BLoC - Practical Use Cases ](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/12/reactive-programming---streams---bloc---practical-use-cases/)
